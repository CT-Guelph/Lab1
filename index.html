  <h1>Writing Assignment 1</h1>
  <p>A software I’d like to speak about is QBittorrent, and it's the torrent client I personally use. It's got an incredibly 
    clean and intuitive interface, even for people who aren’t tech-savvy I’d argue that they won’t have any hiccups navigating 
    around the tools and many features. It has a built-in search engine with a filter option, so I don't have to waste time 
    hunting around for torrents I queued up (unlike others I’ve used). It’s also got a remote control feature where I can 
    manage downloads from my phone as well, which could save me a lot of time when I'm on the go and realize I’ve made a mistake.</p>
  <p>Another one of the things I appreciate about QBittorrent is that it's been incredibly reliable to me, it has rarely ever 
    crashed. Having features like built-in UPnP/NAT-PMP port forwarding, RSS reader, and support for DHT and PEX. These 
    features, allow for seamless network connections, simple updates for contents, and more efficient P2P (Peer-To-Peer) 
    communications, are key reasons that have convinced me personally to use QBittorrent over the plethora of other torrenting 
    softwares. It sounds complex but basically these features make it easier to stabilize a connection, making it smooth, 
    efficient and hassle-free.</p>
  <p>Overall, I’m trying not to glaze QBittorrent too much, but it’s just an incredibly well-designed software for 
    torrenting, and my expectation that it wouldn’t ever give me troubles speaks volumes about its reliability.</p>
  <h1>Writing Assignment 2</h1>
  <p>Getting requirements is the very first step in the software lifecycle. This is the stage
where all developers and stakeholders get together to truly narrow down what it is that end-users
want. This process is not simply about listing features, but to discuss what the system needs to
accomplish and how people will interact with it as well — even exploring any constraint the user
might be experiencing. It is important to get this right because everything else builds off the
foundation you create here. Clarifying the requirements from day-1, considerably reduces
chances of misunderstanding and reshuffling later. In short, this stage is defining an orderly map
of how the final product should be for both what the user needs from it as well as business goals.</p>

not have to find them through manual online searches.</p>
